      <description>If you want to fully understand this post I can only recommand you to read the previous one (Flag 8 part1)
RE102 Reverse Like the previous one, the architecture is Xtensa, but this time I already have the right module for Ghidra !
Using Ghidra I&amp;rsquo;m doing the import and the analysis of the binary.
App Main The app_main function is very similar to RE101, so this time let&amp;rsquo;s jump on the verify function !</description>

      <description>The next 2 Flags are binary reverse, I was very very rusty on this one &amp;hellip;
Wi-Fi Join So, this challenge is accessible from Tom&amp;rsquo;s Hut after you have joined a Wi-Fi network !
To join a Wi-Fi network, you need to access the serial port using screen (check Chall 7 !) and use the following command:
You should receive an IP, you can now go to Tom&amp;rsquo;s Hut and see the following message !</description>

      <description>I was also lucky on this one.
tty CLI After connecting to the device using the serial port with the screen command:
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 If you can¬¥t see your ttyUSB, try using dmesg after connecting the badge on your computer.
And also check your /dev/ folder
Reboot ! As you can see, behind the badge, there is a reboot button, and I keep pressing it by mistake!
However, after looking at the terminal, I saw the full message and a small help menu before the shell!</description>
