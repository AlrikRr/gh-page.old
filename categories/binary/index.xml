      <description>Hello! Today we are going to set up the Swiss army knife of the pentester.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the P4wnP1 ALOA project from RoganDawes!
Initially, the P4wnP1 project comes from MaMe82.Here I will show you how to install the A.L.O.A (A Little Offensive Appliance) version on your RaspberryPi Zero!
The ALOA version is a bit easier to configure and has a graphical interface via a web server for payload configuration.</description>

      <title>#3 ret2libc exploit 32-bit linux</title>

      <description>ret2libc ? This is a flaw that we will exploit on a binary that has the NX (non-executable) protection enabled.
There are several ways to bypass this protection (ROP, ret2plt, etc&amp;hellip;) but here we will focus on ret2libc.
In our program, the stack is not executable but the libc contains many interesting functions and it is executable.
The idea is to go look for the functions that interest us in order to build an exploit.</description>

      <description>ROP 32 ? A ROP 32 works in the same way as a buffer overflow except that there is no shellcode here!
The purpose of a ROP 32 is to call a function of the program that is never called once in the program code.
In this tutorial I will show you how to execute a ROP exploit on a 32bits binary.
Code Here is the code of the program we are going to use:</description>

      <title>#1 Introduction to linux buffer-overflow 32-bit</title>
      <link>https://AlrikRr.github.io/posts/binary-exploitation/binary-tutorials/buffer-overflow/</link>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a BufferOverflow ? A BufferOverflow consists in overwriting the EIP stack of a program at a given time in order to compromise an application.
Stack overflow can be done by different means, but the main problem comes from a bad management of a buffer during the input by a user.
Why ?  To crash an application (a DOS) Have a shell with privileged rights To steal information (Leak Memory) Have a reverse shell or a remote bind shell  Requirements Before starting the exploitation of our binary, we must disable the ASLR protection activated by default under linux.</description>
