      <description>Disclaimer : Hello This is actually my first real Macro while trying to obfuscate and ByPass Defender (Sort Of) ! This Code will escape Defender but the remote payload will not since it was a Meterpreter PowerShell, maybe in the next part üë®‚Äçüíª
Someone asked me to create a file that contains a Macro for downloading a malicious file while evading Defender ! Here is my first attempt, it was cool and might create more with more elaborate code !</description>
